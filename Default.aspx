  <p class="instructions"><i class="fa fa-clock-o"></i> 5 - 10 mins<br/><i class="fa fa-coffee"></i> Ice, Espresso, Whole Milk, Sugar, Flavored Syrup</p>
  <p>The frappuccino is a Starbucks specialty, coffee blended with ice and other ingredients and topped with whip cream. But you don’t have to go out of your way to enjoy this beverage!</p>
<p>Here’s what you need to make your own frappuccino at home:</p>
<ul>
<li>A cup or two of ice</li>
<li>½ cup shot of espresso (or double strength coffee)</li>
<li>½ cup of whole milk</li>
<li>1 to 2 tbsp. of sugar</li>
<li>1 to 2 tbsp. of flavored syrup (mocha, chocolate, etc.)</li></ul>

<p>Is everything ready? Now here’s how to make it:</p>
<ul class="steps">
<li><strong>Step 1.</strong><br/>br/ew the coffee. If you have a coffee grinder, buy whole coffee beans and grind them just before br/ewing as the frappuccino tastes best when made with fresh, ground coffee beans.</li>

<li><strong>Step 2.</strong><br/>Let the coffee cool naturally and wait until it’s at room temperature. Don’t make the mistake of pouring straight onto the ice, the result will not taste right.</li>

<li><strong>Step 3.</strong><br/>After the coffee has cooled, add it with the other ingredients – sugar, milk, and syrup – into the blender. Mix it for about 20 seconds, then fill your blender with ice.</li>
</ul>

<p>The guys over at <a href="http://www.foodservicewarehouse.com/education/how-to-make-a-frappuccino-at-home/c27684.aspx" target="_blank">Food Service Warehouse</a> have a handful of simple but effective tips for making your own frappuccino even if you’ve never been to Starbucks. </p>

  <p>This refreshing and tasty iced coffee drink is yet another Starbucks classic, and just like the frappuccino, the caramel macchiato can be prepared in as little as 5 minutes – perfect for quenching your thirst and entertaining guests.</p>

<p><a href="http://eugeniekitchen.com/iced-caramel-macchiato/" target="_blank">Eugenie Kitchen’s</a> recipe for iced caramel macchiato is very simple. Here’s what you need:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vanilla syrup (20ml)</li>
<li>Cold milk (240ml)</li>
<li>Caramel sauce (20ml)</li>
<li>2 shots of espresso or 80ml of strongly br/ewed coffee</li>
<li>A cup of large ice</li>
</ul>
<p>But preparing it is even simpler:</p>
<ul class="steps">
<li><strong>Step 1</strong>.<br/>	Simply add espresso, milk, vanilla syrup, and ice in a serving cup.</li>
<li><strong>Step 2.</strong><br/>	Blend the concoction until it has a smooth texture.</li>

  <p>This variant of the café latte is an American invention, one inspired by the coffee beverage Bicerin. The café mocha is an espresso-based drink with hot milk and chocolate.</p>

<p>But if you don’t have an espresso machine, worry not!</p>

<p><a href="http://makegoodcoffee.com/cafe-mocha-recipes" target="_blank">Make Good Coffee</a> shows you how to make a café mocha even without an espresso machine. If you can make coffee at home, you’re good to go.</p>

<p>The ingredients are:</p>
<ul>
<li>2/3 cup of mocha or chocolate powder (you can also use chocolate syrup)</li>
<li>2 tbsp. of dark-roasted coffee beans</li>
<li>A cup or two of skimmed milk</li>
<li>Whipped cream</li>
<li>Coffee grinder</li>
</ul>
<p>And here’s how to create your own café mocha:</p>
<ul class="steps">
<li><strong>Step 1.</strong><br/>Prepare your coffee as usual, but you want to time it so that it’s ready at round about the same time as the mocha syrup – making sure that the mix of chocolate and milk isn’t cold.</li>

<li><strong>Step 2.</strong><br/>Heat the milk without letting it burn. Add the mocha / chocolate powder into an oversized mug and pour the skim milk after. Stir it quickly until the powder dissolves.</li>

<li><strong>Step 3.</strong><br/>Pour the coffee into the mug and stir it with the mocha / chocolate syrup.</li>

<li><strong>Step 4.</strong><br/>Add whipped cream and some more mocha powder on top of the drink and that’s it!</li>

  <p>Many espresso-based drinks use milk, but not the café Americano – or simply 'Americano'. The drink also uses espresso but is infused with hot water instead of milk. The result is a coffee beverage that has the same strength of drip coffee but with a different flavor.</p>

<p>If you wanted to make this drink at work, you don't need an <a href="http://www.cafepoint.co.uk/machines/office-coffee-machines">office coffee machine</a>, quite simply all you need to make your own Americano is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Espresso</li>
<li>Hot water</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.starkinsider.com/2012/01/how-to-make-a-caffe-americano-in-5-easy-steps.html" target="_blank">Stark Insider</a> has a very straightforward instruction for preparation:</p>

 <p>Turkish coffee boasts an unrivaled taste, body, and aroma – prepared and presented in time-honored Turkish tradition.</p> 

<p>This isn’t a type of coffee you can easily find in coffee shops. But if you’re looking to make this drink at home, don’t worry. <a href="http://www.foolproofliving.com/how-to-make-turkish-coffee/" target="_blank">Foolproof Living</a> has the exact steps to get you started.</p>

<p>Here's what you need:</p>
<ul>
<li>Turkish coffee</li>
<li>Cold, filtered water (always)</li>
<li>Cezve, a special wide-bottom, copper pot</li>
<li>Sugar</li>
</ul>
<p>Instructions:</p>
<ul class="steps">
<li><strong>Step 1.</strong><br/>Rule of thumb: Use 1 ½ cups of water for every cup of coffee.</li>

<li><strong>Step 2.</strong><br/>Turkish coffee is finer than your regular ground coffee and it’s recommended that you don’t do the grinding yourself. Instead, look for Turkish coffee in Middle Eastern supermarkets.</li>

<li><strong>Step 3.</strong><br/>Add a heaped teaspoon of ground coffee for every coffee cup. Add sugar at the very beginning if you want to sweeten it and stir the mixture.</li>

<li><strong>Step 4.</strong><br/>br/ing the mixture to a boil slowly but surely, using medium heat. The process only takes 3 to 4 minutes so keep an eye on it.</li>

<li><strong>Step 5.</strong><br/>A dark foam will build up as the coffee warms, and you want to use a teaspoon to transfer some of the dark foam into the cup as it’s customary to serve Turkish coffee with the foam on top.</li>

<p>This espresso shot is sweetened after br/ewing and is used as a base for other drinks. Its strength is twice that of traditional American coffee and Cubans drink it as part of their daily morning ritual.</p>

<p>Here’s what you need to make this kick of a drink that’s served in cute, little cups:</p>
<ul>
<li>5 tbsp. of finely ground coffee</li>
<li>A cup of water</li>
<li>4 to 6 teaspoons of sugar</li>
</ul>

<p>Instructions from <a href="http://www.tasteofcuba.com/cafecubano.html" target="_blank">Taste Of Cuba</a>:</p>
<ul class="steps">
<li><strong>Step 1.</strong><br/>Add the finely ground coffee – preferably from dark roasted coffee beans – to your espresso machine, and simply follow the instructions on your machine.</li>

<li><strong>Step 2.</strong><br/>Add a teaspoon of sugar for every demitasse cup of coffee you plan on making as café cubano is meant to be very sweet. One trick to remember here: add the sugar to the carafe before you even br/ew coffee.</li>

<li><strong>Step 3.</strong><br/>br/ew your coffee as you normally would an espresso, pour the liquid into the sugary carafe, and stir it br/iskly to dissolve every grain of sugar.</li>

  <p>Cafe latte is made from espresso (one-third), steam milk (two-thirds), topped with about a centimeter of foam. It’s one of the most popular coffee beverages around, but one that is often mistakenly identified with the flat white thanks to Starbucks.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-a-latte-without-an-espresso-machine-cooking-lessons-from-the-kitchn-211090" target="_blank">The Kitchn</a> shows you how to make your own café latte – even if you’re no barista – using the following ingredients and equipment:</p>

<p>Instructions:</p>
<ul class="steps">
<li><strong>Step 1.</strong><br/>Make your espresso or strongly br/ewed coffee.</li>

<li><strong>Step 2.</strong><br/>Froth the milk by pouring it into a jar, filling the container halfway. Screw the lid on tightly and shake the jar as hard as you can for 30 to 60 seconds.</li>

<li><strong>Step 3.</strong><br/>Microwave the milk uncovered for 30 seconds, allowing the foam to rise to the top of the jar while the heat stabilizes it.</li>

<li><strong>Step 4.</strong><br/>Pour the espresso into a wide, shallow cup, and pour the microwaved milk into the espresso using a large spoon to hold back the foam so you can add as much milk as you like.</li>

<li><strong>Step 5.</strong><br/>Spoon as much milk foam as you prefer onto the latte. Garnish the latte’s top with cocoa powder and you’re good to go!</li>

  <p>A cocktail made of hot coffee, sugar, thick cream, and of course, Irish whiskey!</p>

<p>The beverage has an interesting history: the coffee was invented and named by Joe Sheridan – Foynes, Country Lemerick’s head chef, after American passengers disembarked one evening during the harsh winter of 1940.</p>

<p>The head added whiskey to warm the passengers, marking the birth of the Irish coffee.</p>

<p>You don’t have to suffer the same ordeal that the American passengers went through to get a sip of the Irish coffee.</p>

<p>Here's what you need to make an Irish coffee from the comfort of your home:</p>
<ul>
<li>25ml Irish Whiskey</li>
<li>1 teaspoon of br/own raw cane sugar</li>
<li>1 heaped tbsp. of whipped pouring cream</li>
<li>A hot double espresso</li>
</ul>
<p>Simply follow these instructions from <a href="https://www.goodfoodireland.ie/recipe/irish-coffee" target="_blank">Good Food Ireland</a> and you’re good to go:</p>
<ul class="steps">
<li><strong>Step 1.</strong><br/>Warm your coffee glass and add the whiskey.</li>
<li><strong>Step 2.</strong><br/>Mix in the sugar and stir it to dissolve in the whiskey.</li>
<li><strong>Step 3.</strong><br/>Add the coffee and stir the mixture well.</li>
<li><strong>Step 4.</strong><br/>Whip the cream and pour it over the back of a spoon on top of the cocktail.</li>
</ul>
<p>Irish coffee is usually served as an after-dinner beverage, but you can drink it on its own especially during cold autumn and winter nights.

  <p>This coffee beverage is made by forcing nearly boiling water under pressure through ground coffee beans, resulting in a br/ew that’s thicker than those made from other br/ewing methods.</p>

<p>Espresso is a base for various beverages. Learn how to make an espresso and you’re halfway through learning how to make your own cappuccino, café latte, and macchiato.</p>

<p>And fortunately, Prima Coffee has a beginner’s <a href="https://prima-coffee.com/learn/article/making-espresso" target="_blank">guide for making espresso</a>. Here are the things you need to get started:</p>
<ul>
<li>Espresso machine</li>
<li>Grinder</li>
<li>Portafilter</li>
<li>Tamper</li>
<li>Gram scale</li>
<li>Shot glass</li>
</ul>
<p>Instructions:</p>
<ul class="steps">
<li><strong>Step 1.</strong><br/>Fill the espresso machine’s reservoir with cold, filtered water that isn’t too hard nor too soft. Steer clear from distilled water as it can seriously damage your boiler.</li>

<li><strong>Step 2.</strong><br/>Switch your machine on to heat it up, taking anywhere from 15 to 45 minutes depending on the size of the machine. Once your machine heats br/ewing temperature, wait a little longer until your espresso machine feels warm.</li>

<li><strong>Step 3.</strong><br/>Place a portafilter in the group head and run the espresso machine for a few seconds to br/ing water to the front and heat up parts of the machine that are close to your coffee.</li>

<li><strong>Step 4.</strong><br/>Wipe the inside of the portafilter and underside of the group head to clean.</li>

<li><strong>Step 5.</strong><br/>Grind a few beans and remove stale grounds from your grinder. Take 18 to 21 grams of freshly ground coffee to the portafilter.</li>

<li><strong>Step 6.</strong><br/>Tamp and apply even pressure, using fingertips to feel the edge of the basket.</li>

<li><strong>Step 7.</strong><br/>Return the portafilter in the group head and start br/ewing. If your espresso machine has a pre-br/ew or pre-infusion stage, complete that step first.</li>

<li><strong>Step 8.</strong><br/>Start infusion and end br/ewing to yield 2 oz. or about 30 grams of espresso.</li>

  <p>The cortado is a favorite in Spain, Portugal, and Latin America, often enjoyed as an afternoon drink. The beverage uses espresso that is cut by a small amount of warm milk, reducing its acidity.</p>

<p>The milk used for the cortado is a little cooler than that of the macchiato while having the consistency of the milk used in latte. If you cannot decide between iced and hot coffee, pick the cortado for a change.</p>

<p>Here’s what you need to prepare it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Espresso</li>
<li>Warm and frothy milk</li>
</ul>

<p>To make a cortado, simply…</p>
<ul class="steps">
<li><strong>Step 1.</strong><br/>Extract the espresso straight into a cup.</li>
<li><strong>Step 2.</strong><br/>Cut the espresso with little amounts of warm, frothy milk.</li>
<li><strong>Step 3.</strong><br/>And it’s ready for serving!</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.mycoffeepro.com/476/coffee-recipes-cortado-espresso.html" target="_blank">My Coffee Pro</a> recommends serving the cortado using 150ml to 200ml glasses, with the milk only steamed as the beverage is meant to be less foamy.</p>

  <p>It’s hard to decide whether the affogato is a beverage or a dessert, but that hardly matters. You must try this concoction if you haven’t yet!</p>

<p>The affogato originated from Milan and its name literally translates as “drowned.” Which is fitting as this coffee-based beverage uses the hot and bitter espresso to melt the gelato, resulting to a creamy pool of coffee and ice cream that you’d want to drown in!</p>

<p>Yes, there are only two ingredients necessary for this treat:</p>
<ul>
<li>Espresso</li>
<li>Gelato (Italian-style ice cream)</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are <a href="http://www.tastingtable.com/entry_detail/national/17578/How_to_Make_a_Perfect_Affogato.htm" target="_blank">Tasting Table’s</a> simple steps for making your own affogato:</p>
<ul class="steps">
<li><strong>Step 1.</strong><br/>Chill your glass or mug first and foremost, and make sure that you have a generous amount of gelato (you can use plain ice cream too) that’s really cold to ensure that the entire scoop of ice cream doesn’t melt when you pour hot espresso over it.</li>
<li><strong>Step 2.</strong><br/>Make the espresso just when you’re about to serve so the coffee is as hot and fresh as possible.</li>
<li><strong>Step 3.</strong><br/>Use only an ounce of fresh, hot espresso for every scoop of gelato as you don’t want to drown your ice cream.</li>

<p>Here’s how:</p>
<ul class="steps">
<li><strong>Step 1.</strong><br/>Start by boiling water.</li>
<li><strong>Step 2.</strong><br/>Place a dripper lined with filter on a mug. Be sure to wash the filter with hot water to get rid of any unwanted elements like dust and to preheat the cone too.</li>
<li><strong>Step 3.</strong><br/>Place freshly ground coffee beans in the filter. Remember, you want to br/ew coffee within 30 minutes after grinding the beans.</li>
<li><strong>Step 4.</strong><br/>After the water boils, let it settle for 10 seconds and then slowly pour hot water on the coffee grounds in circular motion, saturating the grounds.</li>
<li><strong>Step 5.</strong><br/>Wait for 30 seconds, allowing the coffee grounds to bubble and soften.</li>
<li><strong>Step 6.</strong><br/>Pour hot water again so the water level is an inch above the grounds. Wait until the water drips through the dripper.</li>

<p>We all know that pouring piping hot coffee over a bunch of ice cubes results to a heavily watered-down drink. Keeping the coffee in the fridge ‘til it is cold, on the other hand, leaves the drink wanting in the flavor and aroma department.</p>

<p>But don’t give up <a href="http://chocolatecoveredkatie.com/2015/06/15/best-iced-coffee-recipe/" target="_blank">Chocolate Covered Katie</a> has a very simple iced coffee trick so you can enjoy iced coffee from the comfort of your own kitchen – and you don’t have to worry about ice diluting the flavor.</p>

<p>Here’s the trick:</p>

<li><strong>Step 1.</strong><br/>br/ew coffee as usual and add the sweetener of your choice at the amount you’d normally add to iced coffee.</li>

<li><strong>Step 2.</strong><br/>Here’s the trick: pour the coffee into an ice cube tray and FREEZE.</li>

<li><strong>Step 3.</strong><br/>Place the coffee cubes into a glass (more coffee cubes, stronger flavor) and pour a glass of milk over the coffee cubes.</li>

<li><strong>Step 4.</strong><br/>Let the coffee cubes melt and mix with the milk, creating a cold yet non-watery coffee to quench your thirst!</li>
